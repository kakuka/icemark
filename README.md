- Utilize MCP integration to get data from regular search engines and various community platforms, increasing the diversity of information sources.

Key characteristics include:
- **AI Assistance**: Helps you think clearly and write deeply.

- **Tool Support**: Allows the AI to solve problems by browsing the web, running commands, and more.
