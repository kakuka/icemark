  <p>Icemark, AI Agent for Product Managers</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

**Icemark** is an AI Agent specifically designed for Product Managers, providing both specialized capabilities like market research, PRD writing, and prototype design, as well as general advanced assistance capabilities to help product managers handle various daily work challenges.

Icemark consists of two main components:

1. **Icemark Agent** - A VSCode extension plugin that executes tasks.
2. **Icemark MCP** - A toolkit that provides Icemark Agent with tools for web searching, content extraction, searches on platforms like Zhihu, Xiaohongshu, and Weibo, as well as language style management and corpus management.

## âœ¨ Assistant-Max Mode

A special highlight is the **Assistant-Max Mode** - an advanced cognitive iterative working mode focused on managing and executing long-term, complex tasks such as:

- Novel writing
- Market research and company analysis
- In-depth analysis on specific topics

Essentially, it can handle any information processing task.

Before starting a task, it creates a detailed plan and confirms it with you, allowing for corrections. It also has task interruption and resumption capabilities - you can stop at any time and resume when you have new materials or ideas.

This mirrors our daily work routine: establishing initial goals and plans, deepening understanding during execution, gradually modifying and adjusting plans, iterating and upgrading, and finally completing tasks.

**Note**: This mode consumes significant tokens. For testing, it's recommended to use low-cost models (we recommend OpenRouter's free DeepSeek R1). However, better models yield better results.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Market Research**: Comprehensive market analysis and competitor research
- **PRD Writing**: Professional Product Requirements Document creation
- **Prototype Design**: Rapid prototyping and design iteration
- **Advanced Assistance**: General AI capabilities for various tasks

## ðŸ›  Technical Foundation

Icemark is built on **Roo Code 1.5.5** with the following key adaptations:

1. **Mode Adaptation**: Added PRD, Prototype, and other modes specifically needed by Product Managers
2. **MCP Toolkit**: Provided comprehensive MCP integration to significantly enhance real-world work processing capabilities
3. **StreamHTTP Protocol Support**: Enhanced collaboration stability and efficiency between Agent and MCP
